# Djangoproject
### Install Django in virtual enviroment. 
### To open VScode type in terminal "code ." and activate env using "source venv/bin/activate".  
### Rmember my main folder is Djangoproject so use "." at the end of the file to take current
### directory as project directory "django-admin startproject Djangoproject .". At this stage settings
### are not configured "django-admin runserver" does not work. Instead, we should use "python manage.### py runserver" to run the server.
