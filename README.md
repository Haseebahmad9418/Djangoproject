# Djangoproject
Install Django in virtual enviroment. 
To open VScode type in terminal "code .". 
Rmember my main folder is Djangoproject so use "." at the end of the file to take current directory as project directory "django-admin startproject Djangoproject .". At this stage settings are not configured "django-admin runserver" does not work. Instead, we should use "python manage.py runserver" to run the server.
